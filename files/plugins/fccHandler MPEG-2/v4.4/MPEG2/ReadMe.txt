MPEG-2 plugin v4.4 by fccHandler
Released February 25, 2012

This is version 4.4 of my MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 and later
versions.  This zip contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit builds of the
plugin.  To use the 32-bit plugin, create a folder named "Plugins32"
in VirtualDub's program folder, and place the "MPEG2.vdplugin" file into
that folder.  To use the 64-bit plugin, create a folder named "Plugins64"
in VirtualDub's program folder, and place the "MPEG264.vdplugin" file into
that folder.  VirtualDub will find and use the plugins automatically.

The plugin allows you to open most MPEG-2 files in the latest version
of VirtualDub.  It was compiled with Visual Studio 2005 Pro, and tested
on Windows XP Pro SP3 and Windows 98SE 32-bit.  I have not personally
tested it on 64-bit Windows platforms.  You can download the full plugin
source code at http://fcchandler.home.comcast.net/Plugins/MPEG2.  Future
updates will also be available at that address.

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public License, and you
should have received a copy of this license as "GPL.txt" in the parent
folder of the distribution.  You may use, modify, and redistribute the
software free of charge, provided you agree to the terms of the GPL.

If necessary I can be contacted at fcchandler at comcast dot net, but I
don't check my e-mail very often unless I'm expecting something.  You'll
get a much quicker response by contacting me at the Unofficial VirtualDub
Support Forums.  (As an administrator I visit there several times a day.)
